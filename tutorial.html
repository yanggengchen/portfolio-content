			<h2>Rules</h2>
			<p>
				During each game, each player will draw 13 tiles as the start hand, then starting from the dealer,
				each player will draw a tile to the player's hand, and then discard a tile in his hand. Upon drawing the tile, 
				if the 14 tiles in the player's hand satisfy a winning hand, the player wins the game. 
			</p>
			<h2>How to play</h2>
			<p>
				We will first introduce some concepts in Japanese Mahjong:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sequence: A set of 3 consecutive tiles (1m2m3m, 5p6p7p etc.)</li>
				<li>Triplet: A set of 3 identical tiles (1m1m1m, 5z5z5z etc.)</li>
				<li>Pair: A set of 2 identical tiles (1m1m etc.)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				After a player has discarded a tile, other players can choose to execute one of the following calls:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Chii: If the tile is discarded by the previous player, and it can form a Sequence with 2 tiles in the player's hand, the player can use the 3 tiles to make a call</li>
				<li>Pon: If the tile can form a Triplet with a pair in the player's hand, the player can use the 3 tiles to make a call</li>
				<li>Kan: If the player has a Triplet identical to the discarded tile, the player can use the 4 tiles to make a call</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				After a player made a call, the player discard one tile and the game continues from the next counter-clockwise player. If the player Kanned, he first draw a tile from the bottom of the tile pile, then discard a tile.
			</p>

			<h2>Winning Hand</h2>
			<p>
				A Winning hand is only formed if the tiles in the player's hand or used to make a call by the player is one of the following cases:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>4 Sequence or Triplet + 1 Pair (1m2m3m7m7m7m4p5p6p2z2z2z5s5s)</li>
				<li>7 Pairs: (1m1m4m4m2p2p9p9p1s1s5z5z7z7z)</li>
				<li>13 Orphans: 1m9m1p9p1s9s1z2z3z4z5z6z7z + one arbitary tile in the previous 13 tiles</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Upon satisfying one of the structure above, the tiles in the player's hand must also satisfy one of the Yaku requirements. If the last tile used to form a hand is obtained from another player, it must also not be in one of the following cases:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The player had discarded one of the potential winning tiles previously</li>
				<li>A potential winning tile had been discarded in the same round and the player did not call it</li>
				<li>A potential winning tile had been discarded after the player called Riichi, and the player did not call the tile</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Some of the common winning hands is shown below:
