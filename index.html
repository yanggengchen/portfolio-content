				and calculated by the sum of number of Han(s) in a player's winning hand.
				Winning hand (or Hu) in Japanese Mahjong is restricted by Yaku and Furiten, meaning a player's hand must correspond to one of the special requirement, 
				and a player must not win on a tile which other players discarded before in the same round, or previously discarded by the player himself.

				have a set of special five tiles (five Man, five Pin, five Sou), 14 tiles among 136 tiles will not be drawn in a game, the dealer will continue to be the dealer if he wins a game.
